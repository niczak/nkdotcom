							I've yet to work with anyone else at the lead level who fostered such a collaborative, positive learning environment for the engineers around him. His deep knowledge of both software design and the business domain helped our team push the boundaries of what was possible to build within a vast, complex software monolith. He has a sharp sense of priorities and an ever sharper sense of humor. I'd recommend working with him to anyone.
